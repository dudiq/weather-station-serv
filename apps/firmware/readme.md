# render json device firmware

This is ordinary device for render json data getting from your server

There are few types of rendering. Ordinary text and image

Why not define weather api inside device and create external server?
- Because in this case you can draw anything with jpeg or just write text messages
- And second point, you can make different requests on server side, instead of device to collect any data and pass it to device
